# This is the start-server scripts that builds the EC2 instances based on the argument value that represent the number of EC2 VMs
# As recommended, we will proceed with m3.medium instances, but keeping that as a variable in the script we can further enhance the same.
# Make sure we have a AWS CLI configured with appropriate AWS ID and secret key
# We are providing a separate makessh.sh script that helps in authorizing and generating the key for ssh mechanism toany EC2 instance from your remote
# machine
# Once the instance is up and running, we retrieve the public DNS for each instances and scp the required files i.e server.jar, server.sh, node.jar and the
# file containing the list of PublicIPs port details to each of the individual EC2 instances.
# Once the files are copied to the appropriate instance, we run our server script that will run in background for each of the build instances so that each instance may
# act as a server responding to a fixed port value, say 3002. (Note: This process executes in background for all instances, any client may now connect to the instances 
# on an appropriate TCP call)
